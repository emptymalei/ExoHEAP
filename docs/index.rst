ExoHEAP
====================================


To finish this project, I need to figure out what HEAP does and what the problems are with exoplanets.

HEAP is dealing with high energy processes in astrophysics environment and most of the cases are related to the generation of photons that can be observed.

That, we need to relate to dynamics of planet formation, evolution and observation.
